## How it work

### Considerations

- Assignment Type: Summative or Formative 
- Weighting: Summative: 60%, Formative: 40%
- Points Earned: Summative, Formative
- Points Possible: Summative, Formative
- Average: Summative, Formative
- Score: Points Earned / Points Possible
- Grade

### Formula - Current

- Grade Current = (Average Summative) * 60% + (Average Formative) * 40%
- Average Summative = Sum of (Points Earned Summative) / Sum of (Points Possible Summative)
- Average Formative = Sum of (Points Earned Formative) / Sum of (Points Possible Formative)


### Formula - Prediction

:: If Summative

- Info required: Points Earned   Summative Prediction
- Info required: Points Possible Summative Prediction

Average Summative Prediction = 
    (Sum of (Points Earned Summative) + Points Earned Summative Prediction) / 
    (Sum of (Points Possible Summative) + Points Possible Summative Prediction)

Grade Prediction = (Average Summative Prediction) * 60% + (Average Formative) * 40% 

:: If Formative

- Info required: Points Earned   Formative Prediction
- Info required: Points Possible Formative Prediction

Average Formative Prediction = 
    (Sum of (Points Earned Formative) + Points Earned Formative Prediction) / 
    (Sum of (Points Possible Formative) + Points Possible Formative Prediction)

Grade Prediction = (Average Summative) * 60% + (Average Formative Prediction) * 40% 

### Data - Current

**Take Bible course as an example:**

Sum of (Points Earned Formative) 
= 140

Sum of (Points Possible Formative)
= 146

Sum of (Points Earned Summative) 
= 104

Sum of (Points Possible Summative)
= 107

### Data - Prediction

- Summative
- Points Earned: 10
- Points Possible: 20



### Input

Use default data set for (A) and (B) for the time being. 

// - (A) Subject (Default: Bible)
// - (B) Data - Current (Defautl: Bible data)

- (C) Summative or Formative
- (D) Points Earned 
- (E) Points Possible

### Output

- (A) Points Earned 
    Summative Current
    Summative Prediction
    Formative Current
    Formative Prediction

- (B) Points Possbile
    Summative Current
    Summative Prediction
    Formative Current
    Formative Prediction

- (C) Average
    Summative Current
    Summative Prediction
    Formative Current
    Formative Prediction

- (D) Grade
