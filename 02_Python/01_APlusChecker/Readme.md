## How it work

### Considerations

- Assignment Type: Summative or Formative 
- Weighting: Summative: 60%, Formative: 40%
- Points Earned: Summative, Formative
- Points Possible: Summative, Formative
- Average: Summative, Formative
- Score: Points Earned / Points Possible
- Grade

### Formula - Current

- Grade Current = (Average Summative) * 60% + (Average Formative) * 40%
- Average Summative = Sum of (Points Earned Summative) / Sum of (Points Possible Summative)
- Average Formative = Sum of (Points Earned Formative) / Sum of (Points Possible Formative)


### Formula - Prediction

:: If Summative

- Points Earned   Summative Prediction
- Points Possible Summative Prediction

Average Summative = 
    (Sum of (Points Earned Summative) + Points Earned Summative Prediction) / 
    (Sum of (Points Possible Summative) + Points Possible Summative Prediction)

Grade Prediction = ほげほげ

:: If Formative

- Points Earned   Formative Prediction
- Points Possible Formative Prediction

Average Formative = 
    (Sum of (Points Earned Formative) + Points Earned Formative Prediction) / 
    (Sum of (Points Possible Formative) + Points Possible Formative Prediction)

Grade Prediction = ふがふが

### Data - Current

Sum of (Points Earned Formative) 
= 8 + 15 + 5 + 15 + 5 + 3 + 3 + 5 + 5
= 64

Sum of (Points Possible Formative)
= 10 + 15 + 5 + 15 + 5 + 3 + 3 + 5 + 5
= 66


Sum of (Points Earned Summative) 
= 18 + 30 + 14 + 27 + 18
= 107

Sum of (Points Possible Summative)
= 18 + 28 + 13 + 26 + 20
= 105

### Data - Prediction

- Summative
- Points Earned: 10
- Points Possible: 20
